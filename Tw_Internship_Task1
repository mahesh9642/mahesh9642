/*TASK 1: Number Guessing Game

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of the number guessing game project in Java is to create an interactive and entertaining game where the player must guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game will provide feedback on each guess, guiding the player to find the correct number within a limited number of attempts. */
